# RecipeNation
An exercise in understanding Node. My first successful Node project!

This webapp was used to easily manage recipes and populate grocery lists between my college roommates and myself.

Here is it running on a server: http://recipenation.herokuapp.com/

## Build and Run
```
npm install 
node app.js
```

## TODO
* General low-hanging fruit refactors
 * mongodb interactions
 * use ejs for header/footer templating instead of whatever the heck I was thinking originally
* GroceryList
 * Share: connect to a TODO service?
 * Add additional custom items to list
